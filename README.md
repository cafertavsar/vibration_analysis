PROJECT OVERVİEW

This thesis project focuses on developing an intelligent system for vibration monitoring and anomaly detection in rotating machinery. The goal is to identify early signs of faults, especially bearing defects, by analyzing vibration data collected from industrial equipment. Early detection helps prevent unexpected failures and reduces maintenance costs.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Rotating machines are critical components in many industries, and their unexpected failures can lead to costly downtime. Traditional fault detection methods often rely on manual inspections or simple threshold-based alarms, which might miss subtle anomalies. This project aims to apply advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of fault detection.

METHODS and ALGORİTHMS

Vibration signal processing techniques were employed to extract meaningful features from raw sensor data.

-Machine learning algorithms, including Isolation Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were implemented to classify normal and faulty states.

-The models were trained and tested on real-world datasets to ensure practical applicability.

-Visual and audio alert systems were integrated to provide real-time fault notifications.

-A web-based dashboard was developed to visualize live data and anomaly status.

DATASET

The vibration datasets used in this project were obtained from publicly available industrial datasets, including the CWRU Bearing Data Center, which provides high-quality labeled data for bearing fault diagnosis. Using standardized datasets enables benchmarking and comparison with existing methods.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

-Development of a robust anomaly detection system capable of real-time monitoring.

-Improvement of fault detection accuracy compared to traditional methods.

-Implementation of user-friendly alert mechanisms for maintenance personnel.

-Providing a comprehensive framework that integrates data acquisition, processing, machine learning, and visualization.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

This project combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation and is aimed at contributing to predictive maintenance strategies in industrial settings.
