# Intelligent Vibration Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System for Rotating Machinery

## Project Overview
This thesis project focuses on developing an intelligent system for vibration monitoring and anomaly detection in rotating machinery. The primary aim is to identify early signs of faults, particularly bearing defects, by analyzing vibration data collected from industrial equipment. Early detection of such anomalies helps prevent unexpected failures and reduces maintenance costs.

## Problem Statement
Rotating machines are critical components in numerous industries, and their unexpected failures can lead to significant financial losses due to downtime. Traditional fault detection methods often rely on manual inspections or simple threshold-based alarms, which may fail to detect subtle anomalies. This project seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of fault detection using advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques.

## Methods and Algorithms
- **Vibration Signal Processing**: Extracted meaningful features from raw sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**:
  - Isolation Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were implemented to classify normal and faulty states.
  - Models were trained and tested on real-world datasets to ensure practical applicability.
- **Real-Time Alert Mechanisms**:
  - Integrated visual and audio alert systems for immediate fault notifications.
- **Web-Based Dashboard**:
  - Developed a dashboard to visualize live data and anomaly status.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available industrial datasets, including the CWRU Bearing Data Center.
- **Description**: High-quality labeled data for bearing fault diagnosis.
- Standardized datasets were utilized to enable benchmarking and comparison with existing methods.

## Expected Outcomes and Contributions
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Development of a robust anomaly detection system capable of real-time monitoring.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Improved fault detection accuracy compared to traditional methods.
- **User-Friendly Alerts**: Implementation of intuitive alert mechanisms for maintenance personnel.
- **Integrated Framework**: A comprehensive system that combines data acquisition, processing, machine learning, and visualization.

## Additional Information
This project combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation and aims to contribute to predictive maintenance strategies in industrial environments.
